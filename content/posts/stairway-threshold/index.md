# Why?

I've always wondered how games are made. Even in middle school, I tried a few times to create something, but I couldn't finish due to my limited knowledge and lack of internet access ðŸ˜„. So, I decided to give it another try.

# Game

> "In Stairway Threshold, you find yourself trapped in the eerie exit stairwell of an abandoned high-rise. This atmospheric horror game blends a modern retro aesthetic with the unsettling ambiance of VHS horror films. Climb through flickering lights and shadowy corners as you ascend towards the building's dark secrets. Will you find your way to freedom, or will the stairwell's sinister grip claim another victim?"

It's a 5 minute thriller horror game. (Yeah, I know ðŸ˜„)

# After Credits

Game development is challenging. It involves everything from programming, modeling, and sound design to level design and creating the game scenario. My initial goal was to finish this game, as many projects I've started in the past have remained incomplete. I know many indie developers struggle to complete their projects. Since this was a new area for me, I set realistic goals.

My next game will be in the same genre, but this time with better graphics and more game mechanics beyond just walking ðŸ˜„. I plan to make it a commercial project. We'll see how it goes.
